# Short-Ruby-Projects

# These are some short, self contained Ruby projects that I use to pratice my programming.

The first of these projects is meant to reinforece OOP concepts. The exercise specifies the followin requirements for a BankAccount Class:

- We need to be able to create new bank accounts with opening balances and the name of the client.
- We should be able to check an account's balance at any time.
- We need to be able to make deposits and withdrawals to those accounts.
- We should be able to transfer funds between accounts.
- We want to have a minimum opening balance. We should be able to change that amount at any time.

A test file is also included for requirements verification.
